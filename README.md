    L key to see maze gen / hide maze generator work<br>
Rest - response only in graph creation mode <br>
(not available during alg work):<br>
    O key to use diagonal conections or not<br>
    R key to reset alg but keep board<br>
    C key to reset entire board <br>
    SPACE key to start alg<br>
